################# **Git Commands Used in This Demo** ##################
**git status**
Shows the current state of the working directory and staging area. It tells you which files have changes that are staged, unstaged, or untracked.

**git add**
Stages file changes (new, modified, or deleted) to prepare them for committing. You need to add changes before they can be saved to the repository history.

**git commit**
Saves the staged changes as a new commit (a snapshot) in the repository, with a descriptive message explaining what was changed.

**git diff**
Displays the differences between your working files and the last commit. Helps you see what changes are not yet staged or committed.

**git checkout**
Switches between branches or restores files. Also used for creating and moving to a new branch to work on a separate line of development.

**git merge**
Combines changes from one branch into the current branch. Useful to integrate new features or fixes developed in other branches.

**git log**
Shows the commit history of the current branch, listing recent commits with their messages and identifiers.

**git mv**
Renames or moves a file in the repository, tracking the change through Git.

**git rm**
Removes files from both the working directory and the repositoryâ€™s tracking, marking them as deleted in the next commit.

**git push**
Sends local commits to a remote repository (like GitHub), updating the central codebase with your changes.

**git pull**
Fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into your current branch, keeping your local repository up to date.
